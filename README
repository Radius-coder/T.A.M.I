I always liked the idea of voice-controlled systems like Iron Manâ€™s Jarvis, but it was not until I watched Artificial Intelligence by Steven Spielberg[1] 
when I was really inspired. In this movie is an intelligent, walking and talking teddy bear that was used by the kids to play with. 
It was also from this I produced the name TAMI, standing for Talking and Moving Intelligence. I liked the idea of bringing a fantasy creature to life whether 
it is a teddy bear or something from a movie or game like a dragon. 
I would like to see my project be used in the health sector as I believe it can help patients with social anxiety or disabilities like dementia.
My computer will remind them of things they need to do such as taking medicine, completing a task, writing a list as well as assisting the user
with any queries such as what restaurants are open nearby, sending an email or playing music. 
The computer can also be modified to aim at children as an educational toy as my computer could provide answers to many 
questions using the internet or used to teach math.
